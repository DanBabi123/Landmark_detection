# Landmark_detection
Landmark Recognition Project
This project focuses on building an image classification model to recognize landmarks from images.

Overview
The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify images of various landmarks. The project uses deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging a pre-trained VGG19 model and fine-tuning it for this specific task.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of different landmarks. The train.csv file contains the mapping between image IDs and their corresponding landmark IDs.

Project Structure
Notebook: The core of the project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab notebook), containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
Data: The image data is expected to be organized in a directory structure accessible by the notebook.
Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:

os
numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
cv2
PIL
sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder
keras
tensorflow
You can install the necessary packages using pip:
